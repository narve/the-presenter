# The Presenter

Turn your new or existing html/markdown content into an online webbased presentation, using one of several presentation frameworks. 

Or just add a "Present"-button that will open your content in a presentation view.

No server, no scripting, no hassle. Just write your content and let *The Presenter* do the rest.

See the GitHub pages for more information and demos:
